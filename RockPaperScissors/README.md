# Challenge 2 - RockPaperScissors

## 📝 Notes


## 🏆 Challenges

> Challenge is to make a brain training game that challenges players to win or lose at rock, paper, scissors.
> * Each turn of the game the app will randomly pick either rock, paper, or scissors.
> * Each turn the app will either prompt the player to win or lose.
> * The player must then tap the correct move to win or lose the game.
> * If they are correct they score a point; otherwise they lose a point.
> * The game ends after 10 questions, at which point their score is shown.
> So, if the app chose “Rock” and “Win” the player would need to choose “Paper”, but if the app chose “Rock” and “Lose” the player would need to choose “Scissors”.
